## Conclusions

* Lattice gauge theory is an important driver of fundamental physics
  and a big consumer of CPU cycles
* HiRep can perform computations for relatively general gauge group and
  fermion representation
* BSMBench and SOMBRERO are benchmarks developed from this code
  * SOMBRERO is more recent and has many advantages over BSMBench
* Both have been used to characterise large systems
  * BSMBench in particular has been used by large vendors to promote
    their systems
